# slides-preview package

Slides-preview is an atom plugin which renders you markdown into slides presentations using [remarkjs](http://remarkjs.com/#1)

I have another project([slides](http://github.com/shafreeck/slides)) that share and sync slides with others.

Install in your atom or using command line

```
apm install slides-preview
```

## Usage:

#### Editing markdown

* slides-preview is a plugin for remarkjs, you write markdown basing on [remarkjs's rules](https://github.com/gnab/remark/wiki/Markdown)
* slides-preview has materiliazie-css's [color system](http://materializecss.com/color.html) builtin, so changing the background or text color is easy

#### Publish

* Render your presentation using html with remarkjs by yourself
* Or generate the HTML using a command line tool:[markdown-to-slides](https://github.com/partageit/markdown-to-slides)
* Or share and sync with others using [shafreeck/slides](https://github.com/shafreeck/slides)
