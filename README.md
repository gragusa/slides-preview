# slides-preview package

Slides-preview is an atom plugin which renders you markdown into slides presentations using remarkjs

I have another project([slides](http://github.com/shafreeck/slides)) that share and sync slides with others.

Install in your atom or using command line

```
apm install slides-preview
```
